          <p>JavaScript is a single threaded programming language ( it has a single run time or a call stack) which means that it can run only one piece of code at a time. When you run a javaScript program , there are many things that happen behind the scenes . The first thing that happens is the creation of an execution context and everything in javaScript happens inside this execution context. So, let's dive deep into the understanding of Execution Context and see how the javaScript code is actually executed behind the scenes.</p>
