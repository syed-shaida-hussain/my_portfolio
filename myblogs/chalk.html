            <strong> NPM Chalk </strong>library in <strong>nodeJs</strong> is
            used for styling the format of text and it allows us to customize
            our own themes in our <strong>nodeJs</strong> projects. We can
            customize the color of the command_line output using Chalk.
            When i was making my quiz projects using javascript , Chalk NPM
            library was really useful to me as i set the color of message for the
            right answer to green and red for the wrong one. This is how using <strong>Chalk NPM library</strong>
            in my projects made them look good and attractive.

        <h2>importing <strong>Chalk</strong> :</h2>

        <p>
            If we want to use <strong>chalk</strong> in our Javascript projects ,
            we need to import Chalk npm library first by using the following
            code snippet.
            <br>
            <br> const chalk = require('chalk');
            <pre></pre>

            After importing the <strong>Chalk NPM library</strong> , we need to
            use it in our projects to make them look good and attractive.
        </p>

        <h2> Using <strong>Chalk</strong> :</h2>

        <p>
            console.log(chalk.color_name("Hello,world!"));
            <pre></pre>
            We can also add more styles to our customized text , like we can 
            make the text bold by using .bold before the color name is mentioned and we will
            get a bold and coloured text. Here is the code snippet.
            <pre></pre>
            console.log(chalk.bold.color_name("Hello,world!"));

        </p>
