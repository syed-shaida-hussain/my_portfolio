        <p>Before doing the level zero of the neogcamp , i was a complete beginner and i didn't even knew the basics of
            programming. I was
            never serious about programming and my carrerr in programming . Even after one year of doing a <strong>CS
                degree</strong>
            , i was never so curious about learning the facts of programming. Learning process at neogcamp level zero
            was done
            in a fun way by the coolest ever teacher and mentor which is none other
            than <strong>Tanay Pratap</strong> sir and the syllabus was also very cool. I made the projects which i
            never thought i would be able to make. Doing the level zero gave me a
            lot of confidence and hope. It also helped me overcoming the fear of
            self doubt and future. One can get a job by completing only
            <strong>five</strong> good projects which is really nice to hear as a
            beginner . The overall structure of the neogcamp is awesome and i would
             recommend all the people reading this to join neogcamp as soon as possible 
             and start your coding journey in a fun way.
